# Cyb Netics Docs

## Hoping to help resolve issues we face with different Setups and Devices for Diabetics.
I will be concentrating on Xdrip, Nightscout, Android Watches, DexcomG6, Omnipods, Dana RS Pump, And Home Assistant but if anything comes along that will help
I will be trying to help with these setups.


I found when I joined xdrip a few years ago there were no documents at all for any of it or help files only little ones spread about all over the place so I started to try to do videos into GitHub where it had never been done before this was in 2018 and from there, I have had to learn not only about my type 1 and collapsing but also doing this project to help. I find it hard at times to understand things due to dyslexia too and my Grammar is terrible.
so please bear with me and please help me by letting me know or maybe changing it yourself for me.

I hope these documents are of some help, but they will be constantly changing due to things happening beyond me to correct their mistakes at charging from their services. I do this as a hobby and when I can do it or have spare time too. and if I do not have the time energy or patience it does not get done.

Other people now have started to do what I was trying to do have now started to do documents and have taken on my ideas on doing what takes a lot of time to do but glad things are moving on for a great bit of software, that all Diabetics should be using.

There is still a long way to go and still things need changing I hope I can help by tryng to do my best to help back on technologies that are beyond my scope to do.

Nightscout is yet again changing due to Heroku charging for their service, so again I'm in yet a position to try to find a way to keep it free like it was supposed to be in 2019 and I need all the help and support from my fellow Diabetes friends in helping me do this. I too need to keep alive with type 1 so I understand how important it is to try to make it a little easier for us all. If you are stuck or need help ask in the groups, or maybe inbox me or email me, I will try my best to help if I can. Or try to do a project on it!

I will not be writing line my line on everything for Xdrip anymore in 2024! I like to get to the points right away e.g. how do I get my watch to work? I cannot in the life of me do every watch setup out there, I can only try to do one that will give you a clue on the setup processes to maybe get your watch to work.
