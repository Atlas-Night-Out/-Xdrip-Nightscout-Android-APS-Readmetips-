# Cyb Netics Docs

## Hoping to help resolve issues we face with different setups and devices for Diabetics.
I will be concentrating on xdrip, Nightscout, Android Watches, DexcomG6, Omnipods, Dana RS Pump


I found when I joined xdrip a few year sago there was no documents at all for it or help files only little ones spread about all over the place so I started to try to do videos into github where it had never been done before thsi was in 2018 and from there I have had to learn not only about my type 1 and collaping but also doing this project to help. I find it hard at times to understand things due to dylexia too and my Grammer is terrible so please bare with me and please help me by letting me know or maybe changing it yourself.

I hope these documents are of some help, but they will be contantly changing due to things happening beyound me to correct there mistakes at charging fro there services. I do this as a hobby and when I can do it. and if I do not have that time energy or patience it does not get done.

Others have now started to do documents and have took on my ideas on doing what takes a lot of time to do but glad things are moving on for a great bit of software, that all Diabetics should be using.

There is still a long way to go and still things need changing and I hope I can help by tryng to do my little to help back on tecnologies that is beyound my scope to do.

Nightscout is yet again changing due to Heroku charging for there service, so again I'm in yet a position to try to find a way to keep it free like its suppose to be and I need all the help and support from my follow Diabetes friends in helping em do this. I too need to keep alive with type 1 so I understand how important it is to try to make it a little easier for us all. If you are stuck or need help ask in the groups, or maybe inbox me or email me, I will try my best to help if I can.

I will not be writing line my line on everything for xdrip I like to get to the points right away e.g like how do i get my watch to work. I cannot in teh life of me do every watch setup out there, do I will try to do one that will give you a clue on the setup process to maybe get your watch to work.
