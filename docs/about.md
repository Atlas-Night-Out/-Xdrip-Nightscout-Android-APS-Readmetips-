The Diabetic way was first created in 2000


#<span style="color:#111478">A little about me </span> <br> 
I have had diabetes for over 50 years now, and during this time I have built up a lot of information and knowledge to hopefully help 
other diabetics by means of exercise and on wearing or having a CGM and pump or Pod with  better food chooses to control are Blood ranges  hopfuly better. 

It's a very difficult and hard disease to cope with let alone deal with other issues in life it's a very hard battle to deal and go through with and for someone to just get the disease can be a nightmare to understanding it all so quickly and find the right information! 

There is lots of information now on the internet now, and in the future but this information can also be very confusing due to things changing that’s very fast and incorrect information too, and also information not keeping up to date on documents for people to know what’s best with latest information for Diabetics to know what Past is and what is the Future to read! Hopefully these Docs will get dated so you will know! But like all Humans we all make and forget! ;-) including myself!

I have been on computers since the Zx81 when it then, was just a black and white screen with no sound, and knowing what I know now now that  way back then in the 1970's that this could be some fun trying to get it to help me with my diabetes in the furture and which it is doing right now for us all.
.
Now in 2021 I see that computers are doing a lot more in helping Diabetics live and manage a easier life and want in some way also try to help where I can in doing so but still hope things will be come even esier

I will not be teaching you on this site of Diabetes itself you will be better visiting My favorite Diabetes web site [Diabetes.uk](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/"The best Diabetes web site for your Diabetes")<a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/" target="_blank">

I will also always be relating to a Type 1 Diabetes not a Type 2 has I do not have this disease myself and would find it hard to relate to it like I do with type 1! A lot what a T1 does will still relate a lot to a T2

I will be also looking at new ways to try to add foods and recipes and to my web site which I invented in Jan 2021 and hope the rest of the diabetes communities take on this new way to their web sites too, with a quick scan on the screen is very helpful tool with myfitnesspal, and  I will  also be trying to add events that Blackburn C.T.C also known as (We are Cycling UK) take me on and hope many more Type ones join me on the rides and I will be sharing the routes for you to join us if you wish to do so!  as I am not a leader in cycling and only do it to better 
control my difficult Diabetes with issues I have with it and controlling it.

I just started the site to learn how to make a web site in the first place and by me learning this I’m now trying to help with new information and programmes that come to are needs and in us having to learn the development of Diabetes getting better with technologies being adapted into are everyday use.

I hope you enjoy the Docs and cycling events but more important is for yourself to get out on a bike (not Car) to help your Diabetes as it won’t help you sitting doing nothing but more important is you enjoy what you are doing.

Xdrip and Nightscout are extremely hard to get setup at the start but once you are setup you will not looking back! It’s the way forward!Xdrip is so much easier to setup and you should be up and running if all goes well in the 2 hour warm up that Decom is of the time of this writing!

I'm also now able to create websites is one big battle I've overcome with grammar issues, so all I need to overcome now is my English literature as 
I'm a terrible writer and grammar too! So, if there is anyone who can kindle spare time and would enjoy doing designs and writing on the site 
please gets in touch with me! Will greatly help me trying to do it correctly!

I want to focus on the future of diabetes and help in guiding people into the new world of CGM and Pumps and also Pods. There are lots to understand in this setup and it's not easy for anyone including myself to do this!
But for these docs I will be doing recipes and foods at the start
you enjoy your stay on the site and I hope it will be a place to keep.
visiting back from time to time for updates and help with video tips and Articles. All the Best to you all and I hope you can have a happier T1 life :-)
