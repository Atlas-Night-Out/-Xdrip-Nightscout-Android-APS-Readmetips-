# Bolus in Watch for AAPS Bolus

## Is Important!
To be able to bolus from yoru watch, you are first going to have installed xdrip+ and setup and working.
You will also needed to have made your own WearOS.APK file and installed onto your watch by sideloading it. I have done video on how to do this and will add document to help you setup when I get time! So stay tuned!
