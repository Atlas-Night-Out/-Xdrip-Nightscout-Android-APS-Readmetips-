# Bolus on Ticwatch Pro 5 Watch from AAPS Watch faces

## Important!
To be able to bolus from your watch, you are first going to have installed xdrip+ and have it setup and working. You will also have needed to make your own WearOS.APK file and installed that onto your watch by sideloading it. I have made a video showing how to do this and I will also  add a document to help you setup when I get time too! So stay tuned! (Grammer corrected by Berni Warren Thank you!)

## Step 1 What you will already needed to have done before you go any further! 

1. Installed xdrip+ onto your Phone, so its getting reading from your CGM. See Install xdrip+
2. Settings added into xdrip+ for you to get readings onto your watch.
3. Make your own WearOs APK file and transfered to your Android Mobile Device.(will add instruction later on this)
4. Your APK file you have just created In Android Studio will needd to be sideloaded onto your Watch as well as as you needing to install xdrip+ onto your watch with sideloading it too, with Wear Installer  2 ( By Malcolm Bryant) 


## *Step 2 Instructions*
1. First  double Click on BG Readings icon on which ever Watch Face you are using for AASP. There are a few to choose from. <br>
