# Bolus on Ticwatch Pro 5 Watch from AAPS Watch faces

Diabetes !102 Years 1921 - 2023

## Important!
To be able to bolus from your watch, you are first going to have installed xdrip+ and have it setup and working on your Phone. You will also have to make your own WearOS.APK file and installed that onto your watch by sideloading it. You do this at your own risk. There is no warrenty on this  I have made a video showing how to do this and I will also  add a document to help you setup when I get time too! So stay tuned! (Grammer corrected by Berni Warren Thank you!)

## Step 1 What you will already needed to have done before you go any further! 

1. Installed xdrip+ onto your Phone, so its getting reading from your CGM. See Install xdrip+
2. Make your own AAPS_3.1.0.3.APK file. And have AAPS 3.1.0.3.APS file installed onto your Phone, and then within the ConfigBuilder you need to enable the Wear plugin. You can get teh code from Github from https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS  to make your own AAPS.APK file to install.<br>
You can see my video on how to do this process from https://youtu.be/VwG-rOolBDM  but you will need to choose Android_3.1.0.5 APP.Main instead when Building! <img width="300" height="auto" border="0" align="center"  src="/my-project/img/AAPS/Android_3.1.0.5 App Main.jpg" title="Android_3.1.0.5 APP.Main"/>

3. Settings added into xdrip+ for you to get readings onto your watch.
4. Make your own WearOs APK file and transfered to your Android Mobile Device.(will add instruction later on this)
5. Your APK file you have just created In Android Studio will need to be sideloaded onto your Watch. You will also need to install xdrip+ onto your watch with sideloading it too, with Wear Installer  2 for both of them ( By Malcolm Bryant)
