There is lots of information now on the internet now, and in the future but this information can also be very confusing due to things changing that\u2019s very fast and incorrect information too, and also information not keeping up to date on documents for people to know what\u2019s best with latest information for Diabetics to know what Past is and what is the Future to read! Hopefully these Docs will get dated so you will know! But like all Humans we all make and forget! ;-) including myself!

Part 4 - Fork and Deploy cgm remote monitory If you would like to follow these instructions with video then see below other wise continue step by step below video Instructions, Note! If you have already forked your cgm-remote-monitor, before reaching this stage, you should delete the existing cgm-remote-monitor repository before proceeding. Delete your current cgm-remote-monitor fork using ( Video STEP !). 1. Hopfully you should now have 3 pages opened in your browser: Heroku, Atlas, and Github, Make sure you are logged-in on each one ( i.e. important ) before you continue. Click Here or goto https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor, to open a new GitHub page. Click the on Fork icon in the top right Wait for a moment Scroll down the page and click Deploy to Heroku Enter in your Heroku account a site name: invent a name you would like to use or see your BG in on the internet. Confirm that the name is available. Don\u2019t change the region. Scroll down and setup the following variables: You can come back to these later later by going to settings and config Vars Enable in Heroku! Note! The API_SECRET is the main password allowing full access to your Nightscout site. Make sure its secure (mix upper and lowercase letters, plus digits) and do no not share it publicly. If you think you exposed it by mistake, it is recommended that you change it. 7. API_SECRET will be your Nightscout site password, it needs to be at least 12 characters long and you should NOT use spaces if you use @ or ! symbol you should NOT use spaces if you use @ or ! symbols remember you will probably need to express them using Percent encoding in your uploader and downloader apps. If you're not sure on how to do this, it is recommended to use only letters (uppercase + lowercase) and digits . 8. If you want to link your Dexcom Share account as a data source, complete the following 3 lines: Warning! Common Errors MOST COMMON ERRORS The BRIDGE_PASSWORD and BRIDGE_USER_NAME are NOT visible from within your Dexcom app or online account. These values are what you entered into your Dexcom mobile app when you logged into that app for the VERY FIRST time. The BRIDGE_USER_NAME is not an email address. The most common error on initial Nightscout setups is that people incorrectly use an old account or an old password. To test your username and password, go to Dexcom's Clarity page (check here See Here for USA accounts and Here here for the others) and try logging in to your Dexcom account. If your account info isn't valid, or you don't see any data in your Clarity account... you need to figure out your actual credentials before moving ahead. 9. If you want to link your Care Link account as a data source (currently not functional with Heroku), complete the following lines: 10. Select the units you\u2019re using in DISPLAY_UNITS the acceptable choices are mg/dl or mmol/L (or just mmol when entering it). In my case I used mmol Plugins 11 In ENABLE, copy and paste the following Plugins below (separated by a space) so that won't have to think about which you want now and learn the rest later!

Now you need the connection string you defined during the Atlas cluster creation - Part 3 (as the example below, but not the string below). Copy and paste your! results into the MONGODB_URI variable field in Heroku vars. 13. I will try to give you an example about the way to do it again below, you can also see my video if you get stuck! A. In the boxes below 1st is your Atlas Account you gave yourself a User Name add it to the box below User Name on the left side! B. Then you also made a Database user Password add your Password you created for your database add this too into the box on the left side. C. And lastly you made up a Database Name , also add this to the last box on the left and click the Generate button which will generate your connection string code that you will need to add to your Heroku API I have given you my examples below on the right side of the boxes so just ignore them they are my examples to show you how the connection string is made up! username: Eg: username: Database password: Eg: Database password: @cluster0:xxxxx E.g: cluster0.xxxxx Database Name: E.g: Database Name: Generate D. After you have generated it, yours should look similar to the one below mine might be a little different to what yours should be so do check it carefully, and make sure to copy and paste it into notepad like I show you in the video below mongodb+srv:// : @cluster0. .mongodb.net/ ?retryWrites=true&w=majority My Connection String results mongodb+srv://nightkai:Madeuppassword7@cluster0.j2iil.mongodb.net/kdatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority Warning! Keep this string safely aside, it is called your MONGODB_URI function myFunction() { document.getElementById(\"field3\").value = document.getElementById(\"username\").value; document.getElementById(\"field4\").value = document.getElementById(\"dbpassword\").value; document.getElementById(\"field5\").value = document.getElementById(\"dbname\").value; document.getElementById(\"field6\").value = document.getElementById(\"@cluster\").value; } video demo of getting connection string, 14. Once you have added your Connection string into the MongoDB_Uri. Scroll down to the bottom of the Config var list and click the Deploy APP You will WAIT until a while for them completion. Do not stop the process until it's complete. 15. click the View button and it should come up (if not, then click the Manage App -> Open App, in the top right corner) 16. Your Nightscout site should open and direct you to fill in profile editor for Nightscout. 17. All you need to fill in at this moment in time is your Time zone and eventually all the other fields e.g. Insulin to carbs. Make sure to not leave any fields empty. If you don't understand which value to use, just use the default value . a. You can come back and change these values later at any time by going to your Nightscout URL selecting the Hamberger icon on the right and selecting profile editor . 18. You will then need to go down to Authentication Status on the left and click Authentication. And enter your Heroku API secret you made earlier. Then click Authenticate button , Then save . Your Privacy warning! Anyone with your URL of your Nightscout site, can view your values and run reports of your data. It is recommended that you enable security to your site once you're done this setup. 19. Dexcom Share and CareLink users should see data working after a few minutes. Other uploaders like xDrip+ , Spike , xDrip4iOS, Gimp,Tomato etc will need to be setup with a Nightscout address and API secret in each Apps settings ( See Uploaders ). Nightscout Address for your Uploader Apps PAPERTRAIL a. Lastly, you might want to change the PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN line. Heroku gives you a free, tiny amount of Papertrail service (this is like a logging service for how the site is running), but this generates a lot of confusion to most people later on. when they get a message that their \"Free Papertrail Service has run out of room\". Papertrail is not needed at all, edit the line with the pensil icon and add DISABLED at the end, so that you can recover the function if you need it later. Congratulations Nightscout is now setup! Enable Auto Deploys in Heroku Automatic deploys will allow you to update routinely your Heroku apps when you renew the GitHub repository. You will then not need to login into Heroku and execute Manual Deploy, as soon as do a new version of the repo be merged into GitHub an automatic deploy will trigger in all enabled Heroku apps. a) To allow automatic deploy, log in Heroku and select your app, in my case diabeticway and then selecting the Deploy section . b) Select Connect to Github c) Authenticate GitHub and your cgm-remote-monitor app are now connected. d) Click on search and add your repo name, it will then connect to Github e) Verify the master branch is selected and click Enable Automatic Deploys . f) Your site will update automatically every time you update the GitHub repository now.

Nightscout Plugins Plugins Plugins are used extend the way information is displayed, how notifications are sent, alarms are triggered, and more. The built-in/example plugins that are available by default are listed below. The plugins may still need to be enabled by adding to the ENABLE environment variable. Default Plugins These can be disabled by adding them to the DISABLE variable, for example DISABLE=\"direction upbat\" delta (BG Delta) Calculates and displays the change between the last 2 BG values. direction (BG Direction) Displays the trend direction. upbat (Uploader Battery) Displays the most recent battery status from the uploader phone. . Use these extended setting to adjust behavior: UPBAT_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable uploader battery alarms via Pushover and IFTTT. UPBAT_WARN (30) - Minimum battery percent to trigger warning. UPBAT_URGENT (20) - Minimum battery percent to trigger urgent alarm. timeago (Time Ago) Displays the time since last CGM entry. Use these extended setting to adjust behavior: TIMEAGO_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable stale data alarms via Pushover and IFTTT. ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN (on) - possible values on or off ALARM_TIMEAGO_WARN_MINS (15) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a warning ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT (on) - possible values on or off ALARM_TIMEAGO_URGENT_MINS (30) - minutes since the last reading to trigger a urgent alarm devicestatus (Device Status) Used by upbat and other plugins to display device status info. Supports the DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED=\"true\" extended setting to send all device statuses to the client for retrospective use and to support other plugins. errorcodes (CGM Error Codes) Generates alarms for CGM codes 9 (hourglass) and 10 (???). Use extended settings to adjust what errorcodes trigger notifications and alarms: ERRORCODES_INFO (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8) - By default the needs calibration (blood drop) and other codes below 9 generate an info level notification, set to a space separate list of number or off to disable ERRORCODES_WARN (off) - By default there are no warning configured, set to a space separate list of numbers or off to disable ERRORCODES_URGENT (9 10) - By default the hourglass and ??? generate an urgent alarm, set to a space separate list of numbers or off to disable ar2 (AR2 Forecasting) Generates alarms based on forecasted values. See Forecasting using AR2 algorithm Enabled by default if no thresholds are set OR ALARM_TYPES includes predict. Use extended settings to adjust AR2 behavior: AR2_CONE_FACTOR (2) - to adjust size of cone, use 0 for a single line. simplealarms (Simple BG Alarms) Uses BG_HIGH, BG_TARGET_TOP, BG_TARGET_BOTTOM, BG_LOW thresholds to generate alarms. Enabled by default if 1 of these thresholds is set OR ALARM_TYPES includes simple. profile (Treatment Profile) Add link to Profile Editor and allow to enter treatment profile settings. Also uses the extended setting: PROFILE_HISTORY (off) - possible values on or off. Enable/disable NS ability to keep history of your profiles (still experimental) PROFILE_MULTIPLE (off) - possible values on or off. Enable/disable NS ability to handle and switch between multiple treatment profiles Advanced Plugins: careportal (Careportal) An optional form to enter treatments. boluscalc (Bolus Wizard) food (Custom Foods) An option plugin to enable adding foods from database in Bolus Wizard and enable . rawbg (Raw BG) Calculates BG using sensor and calibration records from and displays an alternate BG values and noise levels. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting DISPLAY (unsmoothed) - Allows the user to control which algorithm is used to calculate the displayed raw BG values using the most recent calibration record. unfiltered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's unfiltered value. filtered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's filtered value. The glucose record's filtered values are generally produced by the CGM by a running average of the unfiltered values to produce a smoothed value when the sensor noise is high. unsmoothed - Raw BG is calculated by first finding the ratio of the calculated filtered value (the same value calculated by the filtered setting) to the reported glucose value. The displayed raw BG value is calculated by dividing the calculated unfiltered value (the same value calculated by the unfiltered setting) by the ratio. The effect is to exagerate changes in trend direction so the trend changes are more noticeable to the user. This is the legacy raw BG calculation algorithm. iob (Insulin-on-Board) Adds the IOB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with insulin doses and the dia and sens fields from the treatment profile. cob (Carbs-on-Board) Adds the COB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with carb doses and the carbs_hr, carbratio, and sens fields from the treatment profile. bwp (Bolus Wizard Preview) This plugin in intended for the purpose of automatically snoozing alarms when the CGM indicates high blood sugar but there is also insulin on board (IOB) and secondly, alerting to user that it might be beneficial to measure the blood sugar using a glucometer and dosing insulin as calculated by the pump or instructed by trained medicare professionals. The values provided by the plugin are provided as a reference based on CGM data and insulin sensitivity you have configured, and are not intended to be used as a reference for bolus calculation. The plugin calculates the bolus amount when above your target, generates alarms when you should consider checking and bolusing, and snoozes alarms when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG. Uses the results of the iob plugin and sens, target_high, and target_low fields from the treatment profile. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting BWP_WARN (0.50) - If BWP is > BWP_WARN a warning alarm will be triggered. BWP_URGENT (1.00) - If BWP is > BWP_URGENT an urgent alarm will be triggered. BWP_SNOOZE_MINS (10) - minutes to snooze when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG.

This plugin provides pill that indicates size of Database and shows (when configured) alarms regarding reaching space limit. IMPORTANT: This plugin can only check how much space database already takes, but cannot infer max size available on server for it. To have correct alarms and realistic percentage, DBSIZE_MAX need to be properly set - according to your mongoDB hosting configuration. NOTE: This plugin rely on db.stats() for reporting logical size of database, which may be different than physical size of database on server. It may work for free tier of MongoDB on Atlas, since it calculate quota according to logical size too, but may fail for other hostings or self-hosted database with quota based on physical size. NOTE: MongoDB Atlas quota is for all databases in cluster, while each instance will get only size of its own database only. It is ok when you only have one database in cluster (most common scenario) but will not work for multiple parallel databases. In such case, spliting known quota equally beetween databases and setting DBSIZE_MAX to that fraction may help, but wont be precise. All sizes are expressed as integers, in Mebibytes 1 MiB == 1024 KiB == 1024*1024 B DBSIZE_MAX (496) - Maximal allowed size of database on your mongoDB server, in MiB. You need to adjust that value to match your database hosting limits - default value is for standard Heroku mongoDB free tier. DBSIZE_WARN_PERCENTAGE (60) - Threshold to show first warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size - pill will show size in yellow. DBSIZE_URGENT_PERCENTAGE (75) - Threshold to show urgent warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size, it is urgent to do backup and clean up old data. At this percentage info pill turns red. DBSIZE_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable notifications about database size. DBSIZE_IN_MIB (false) - Set to true to display size of database in MiB-s instead of default percentage. This plugin should be enabled by default, if needed can be diasabled by adding dbsize to the list of disabled plugins, for example: DISABLE=\"dbsize\". Extended Settings Some plugins support additional configuration using extra environment variables. These are prefixed with the name of the plugin and a _. For example setting MYPLUGIN_EXAMPLE_VALUE=1234 would make extendedSettings.exampleValue available to the MYPLUGIN plugin. Plugins only have access to their own extended settings, all the extended settings of client plugins will be sent to the browser. DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED (true) - Defaults to true. Users who only have a single device uploading data to Nightscout can set this to false to reduce the data use of the site. DEVICESTATUS_DAYS (1) - Defaults to 1, can optionally be set to 2. Users can use this to show 48 hours of device status data for in retro mode, rather than the default 24 hours. Setting this value to 2 will roughly double the bandwidth usage of nightscout, so users with a data cap may not want to update this setting. Pushover In addition to the normal web based alarms, there is also support for Pushover based alarms and notifications. To get started install the Pushover application on your iOS or Android device and create an account. Using that account login to Pushover, in the top left you\u2019ll see your User Key, you\u2019ll need this plus an application API Token/Key to complete this setup. You\u2019ll need to Create a Pushover Application. You only need to set the Application name, you can ignore all the other settings, but setting an Icon is a nice touch. Maybe you'd like to use this one? Pushover is configured using the following Environment Variables: ENABLE - pushover should be added to the list of plugin, for example: ENABLE=\"pushover\" . PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN - Used to enable pushover notifications, this token is specific to the application you create from in Pushover , additional pushover information below. PUSHOVER_USER_KEY - Your Pushover user key, can be found in the top left of the Pushover site, this can also be a pushover delivery group key to send to a group rather than just a single user. This also supports a space delimited list of keys. To disable INFO level pushes set this to off . PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide alarms (level > WARN ). If not defined this will fallback to PUSHOVER_USER_KEY . A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to a CWD that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Alarm pushes set this to off . PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to PUSHOVER_USER_KEY or PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY . This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Announcement pushes set this to off . BASE_URL - Used for pushover callbacks, usually the URL of your Nightscout site, use https when possible. API_SECRET - Used for signing the pushover callback request for acknowledgments. If you never want to get info level notifications (treatments) use PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=\"off\" If you never want to get an alarm via pushover use PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY=\"off\" If you never want to get an announcement via pushover use PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY=\"off\" If only PUSHOVER_USER_KEY is set it will be used for all info notifications, alarms, and announcements For testing/development try localtunnel . IFTTT Maker In addition to the normal web based alarms, and pushover, there is also integration for IFTTT Webhooks. With Maker you are able to integrate with all the other IFTTT Services. For example you can send a tweet when there is an alarm, change the color of hue light, send an email, send and sms, and so much more. Setup IFTTT account: login or create an account Follow the Detailed IFTTT setup Instructions Configure Nightscout by setting these webpage environment variables: ENABLE - maker should be added to the list of plugins, for example: ENABLE=\"maker\". MAKER_KEY - Set this to your secret key (see [Detailed Instructions ) MAKER_KEY=\"abcMyExampleabc123defjt1DeNSiftttmak-XQb69p\" This also supports a space delimited list of keys. MAKER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Maker key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to MAKER_KEY. A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to another device that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. Plugins can create custom events, but all events sent to IFTTT webhooks will be prefixed with ns-. The core events are: ns-event - This event is sent to the maker service for all alarms and notifications. This is good catch all event for general logging. ns-allclear - This event is sent to the maker service when an alarm has been ack'd or when the server starts up without triggering any alarms. For example, you could use this event to turn a light to green. ns-info - Plugins that generate notifications at the info level will cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-warning - Alarms at the warning level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-urgent - Alarms at the urgent level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. see the full list of events Treatment Profile Some of the plugins make use of a treatment profile that can be edited using the Profile Editor, see the link in the Settings drawer on your site.

Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting DISPLAY (unsmoothed) - Allows the user to control which algorithm is used to calculate the displayed raw BG values using the most recent calibration record. unfiltered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's unfiltered value. filtered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's filtered value. The glucose record's filtered values are generally produced by the CGM by a running average of the unfiltered values to produce a smoothed value when the sensor noise is high. unsmoothed - Raw BG is calculated by first finding the ratio of the calculated filtered value (the same value calculated by the filtered setting) to the reported glucose value. The displayed raw BG value is calculated by dividing the calculated unfiltered value (the same value calculated by the unfiltered setting) by the ratio. The effect is to exagerate changes in trend direction so the trend changes are more noticeable to the user. This is the legacy raw BG calculation algorithm. iob (Insulin-on-Board) Adds the IOB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with insulin doses and the dia and sens fields from the treatment profile. cob (Carbs-on-Board) Adds the COB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins.

The values provided by the plugin are provided as a reference based on CGM data and insulin sensitivity you have configured, and are not intended to be used as a reference for bolus calculation. The plugin calculates the bolus amount when above your target, generates alarms when you should consider checking and bolusing, and snoozes alarms when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG. Uses the results of the iob plugin and sens, target_high, and target_low fields from the treatment profile. Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting BWP_WARN (0.50) - If BWP is > BWP_WARN a warning alarm will be triggered. BWP_URGENT (1.00) - If BWP is > BWP_URGENT an urgent alarm will be triggered. BWP_SNOOZE_MINS (10) - minutes to snooze when there is enough IOB to cover a high BG.

At this percentage info pill turns red. DBSIZE_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable notifications about database size. DBSIZE_IN_MIB (false) - Set to true to display size of database in MiB-s instead of default percentage. This plugin should be enabled by default, if needed can be diasabled by adding dbsize to the list of disabled plugins, for example: DISABLE=\"dbsize\". Extended Settings Some plugins support additional configuration using extra environment variables. These are prefixed with the name of the plugin and a _. For example setting MYPLUGIN_EXAMPLE_VALUE=1234 would make extendedSettings.exampleValue available to the MYPLUGIN plugin. Plugins only have access to their own extended settings, all the extended settings of client plugins will be sent to the browser. DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED (true) - Defaults to true. Users who only have a single device uploading data to Nightscout can set this to false to reduce the data use of the site. DEVICESTATUS_DAYS (1) - Defaults to 1, can optionally be set to 2. Users can use this to show 48 hours of device status data for in retro mode, rather than the default 24 hours. Setting this value to 2 will roughly double the bandwidth usage of nightscout, so users with a data cap may not want to update this setting. Pushover In addition to the normal web based alarms, there is also support for Pushover based alarms and notifications.

A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to another device that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. Plugins can create custom events, but all events sent to IFTTT webhooks will be prefixed with ns-. The core events are: ns-event - This event is sent to the maker service for all alarms and notifications. This is good catch all event for general logging. ns-allclear - This event is sent to the maker service when an alarm has been ack'd or when the server starts up without triggering any alarms. For example, you could use this event to turn a light to green. ns-info - Plugins that generate notifications at the info level will cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-warning - Alarms at the warning level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-urgent - Alarms at the urgent level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. see the full list of events Treatment Profile Some of the plugins make use of a treatment profile that can be edited using the Profile Editor, see the link in the Settings drawer on your site. Treatment Profile Fields: timezone (Time Zone) - time zone local to the patient. Should be set. units (Profile Units) - blood glucose units used in the profile, either \"mg/dl\" or \"mmol\" dia (Insulin duration) - value should be the duration of insulin action to use in calculating how much insulin is left active. Defaults to 3 hours. carbs_hr (Carbs per Hour) - The number of carbs that are processed per hour, for more information see #DIYPS. carbratio (Carb Ratio) - grams per unit of insulin. sens (Insulin sensitivity) How much one unit of insulin will normally lower blood glucose. basal The basal rate set on the pump. target_high - Upper target for correction boluses. target_low - Lower target for correction boluses.

Sit back have a cuppa and enjoy video waiting for your email to \u201cConfirm Account\u201d before you advance to the next section. e. Host Name You will be given a Hostname, that you will use to go to your nightscout site later and also add it to your settings and other things like when you setup a Follower. I will show you an example Host below. 2. Google Account a. You need a Google account to proceed. If you do not have one go to https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en and sign up or Google Account Once you have created a Google account Go to 3.

For you to select in the next process you need to do. see Section 14. below now. The above three regions are the regions your virtual machine can be located, not where you have to be in living. In other words if you live in the U.K you still need to pick one of the three above. Oregon. Lowa, or South Carlolina to get a free Tier i. Process you need to do now Go to the dashboard. Select \u201cCompute Engine\u201d . Select the \u201cVM instances\u201d tab in the left pane if it\u2019s not already selected. Select \u201cCreate Instance\u201d. j. Settings you need to fill in Now: 1. Set name to \u201cnightscout\u201d. 2. Set machine type to \u201ce2-micro 1GB\u201d. 3. Select a region that qualifies for free tier . k. Go Down to Boot Disk Section : Edit it by clicking on change \u201cBoot Disk\u201d and modify as shown below. Click on \u201cSelect\u201d. 1. Ubunta . 2.

Under the firewall Section, a. enable both http and https . m. Click on \u201cCreate\u201d to start creating the virtual machine. Google will now bring up your virtual machine after its finished which will take a while, so sit back and relax. n. After the external IP address column is finished, click on \u201cSSH\u201d on the right side of the IP address. A terminal will appear shortly. This should bring up your browser, if it dosn't like it did not with me in firefox browser I had to allow popups for it to work! o. Copy and paste the following line into the terminal window that has just come up. Be very cautious not to copy it into any other machine as it will overwrite the contents of the machine. Copy the code below into teh teminal. curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamorham/nightscout-vps/vps-1/bootstrap.sh | bash You might get a pop up preventing you from opening the terminal window. If you do, select the options and allow the popups window. Then select the SSH again to open it. 4. Now Wrap up Linux installation a. If you get an error message that says (EINTEGRITY) ending with (0 bytes) and it hangs, just press CTRL and C keys at the same time to interrupt. Then, re-run the curl bootstrap command above that you have just entered into it again. You can use the up arrow on the terminal to go back to the previous command entries. b. After the installation is finalized, you will be asked to login. To log into the virtual machine, use the email address and password you used to register from when you did your Noip Account c. Terminal Process: Now Leave the update interval at 30. Select N for running command during update Enter email address \u201cused for urgent renewal Press A to accept the terms of service. Press N to decline sharing email address. Select 2 to redirect to secure https. If you want to copy your old nightscout site, please state the name here ( Example: https://site.herokuapp.com) To skip just press enter. I added my old Herroku account here. API secret: You will be asked to replace the API secret. This is the password you will login to Nightscout with later. Enter a password and take note of it and keep safe. It needs to be more than 12 characters long I would also not use symbols characters within making your password, I don't think xdrip likes it. Installation is Complete: When you see the following, the installation is complete and you can close the terminal by clicking on X at the top right corner of the terminal window. 5. Now We need to Set up Nightscout: Set up Nightscout: a. Use a web browser and copy your hostname from noip. And Paste it into your browser. (from when you registered at noip.com). b. This will bring up your Nightscout. It will ask you for a password. Enter your API-Secret you did earlier in the Google Cloud terminal. Check \u201cRemember this device\u201d checkbox to avoid having to re-enter it. c. On first time, Nightscout will ask you to set up a profile for sensitivity etc. Either enter real values or just click save and then use close button on top right of the screen. You may need to do this twice 6. Set up xDrip to upload to your Nightscout This is what you need to do in xDrip on your master (Main) phone. a. Go to xDrip Settings \u2212> Cloud Upload \u2212> Nightscout Sync (REST-API). b. Select Enable at the top. c. Let\u2019s say the hostname you chose when you signed up for noip.com was hostname. And let\u2019s say you set the API secret, while finalizing the installation as explained in the previous section, to API-Secret. d. Tap on Base URL. Enter the following. https://API-Secret@hostname/api/v1/ That\u2019s it. Your xDrip readings should now upload to your Nightscout on Google Cloud. If not triple check the way you have added your Base URL correctly, it is very case sensitive! 7. Set up xDrip uploader to go to your AndroidAPS Basic settings for Most CGM Warning! (I have not tested this bit on AndroidAPS so please report any issues if you have any. Links are at the bottom of the page!) This is the same has above except your Url will be your web address noip Host address, not like xdrip's where it has Both Secret and Noip host on one line, with the added api/v1 at the end of it. In AASP it is done separately, you add your Nightscout Web URL and then add your Secret in NS API secret below. There is no api/v1 in it at all. a. Set your Nightscout URL e.g. https://yoursitesname.ddns.net b. You will also need to Disable Upload treatments and Back-fill data from xDrip+, or else treatments can be doubled in AAPS leading to false COB and IOB. c. Alert on failures should also be deactivated. These are in your settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / Extra Options. d. Also Disable Automatic Calibration you can enable it for the first time but then after that it will need to be Disabled. you can do this by selecting the Download treatments to switch Automatic calibration (on/Off) You can do this at: Settings/Cloud Upload/Nightscout Sync (REST-API) / 8. How to Configure DDNS (Dynamic DNS) in a Router a. Is another issue some of you may face if you do not have a static Ip address. There is software available for you to download from noip called a Dynamic update client . Which can be ok during the day while your computer is running but not so good at night if you wish to be saving power and turning your computer off, has this can and will stop your nightscout from running if your ip changes while your computer is off, making it an unsafe process for nightscout at night. b. The next video method is good for them that are able to use these router's but again some of us cannot use these methods and these kinds of router with a DHCP some are on routers that only have a DHCU c. This I found very frustrating to have to go through all of this due to some Service providers preventing you having a static Ip address. And this process I hope will help resolve a lot of them for you. But again, a cost in having to buy a second router! I did this setup running on a Hub 3.0 VMDG505/TG2492LG-VM 9. Create Acess Tokens and Roll Set up Nightscout tokens for your followers and AndroidAPS a. Go to your Web site Nightscout and verify again and verify API-Secret again if needed. See \"Now We need to Set up Nightscout\" above. And click on the top right menu button. b. Click on \"Admin Tools\" c. You will see seven predefined roles: Roles admin: full Access Readable: read-only access; no ability to make CarePortal/treatment entries. This user can view reports and profile information. Careportal: can view the site and make CarePortal/treatment entries Denied: no access (this role only works if the AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES setting is also denied. You can\u2019t have a site that is readable to everyone and create a \u201cdenied\u201d token for a specific user.) Devicestatus-upload: used by devices. d. Make a Token Click the 'Add New Subject' e. In the form that opens, enter a name. Then under \u201cRoles\u201d, copy a role from the table. For example, for your dad that is only supposed to see your readings and nothing else and not be able to enter any other details or do anything else, then enter 'readable' in the roles section. You can enter a combination of different roles by separating them with \u201c,\u201d You can also add an optional comment if you like, and then click the save button. f. The token will be displayed. You can use it in two various ways: Now make sure to take a note of the access token, that you are given You can create multiple tokens with specific permissions for each. Note! Now make sure to take a note of the access token, that you are given. You can create multiple tokens with specific permissions for each. 10. Setting up xDrip as a (follower) like your dad, from the example above a. In the xDrip Data Source Settings, choose \u201cNightscout Follower\u201d as the hardware data source.

Part 4 - Fork and Deploy cgm remote monitory If you would like to follow these instructions with video then see below other wise continue step by step below video Instructions, Note! If you have already forked your cgm-remote-monitor, before reaching this stage, you should delete the existing cgm-remote-monitor repository before proceeding. Delete your current cgm-remote-monitor fork using ( Video STEP !). 1. Hopfully you should now have 3 pages opened in your browser: Heroku, Atlas, and Github, Make sure you are logged-in on each one ( i.e. important ) before you continue. 2. Click Here or goto https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor, to open a new GitHub page. Click the on Fork icon in the top right 3. Wait for a moment 3.1. Scroll down the page and click Deploy to Heroku 4. Enter in your Heroku account a site name: invent a name you would like to use or see your BG in on the internet. Confirm that the name is available. 5. Don\u2019t change the region. 6. Scroll down and setup the following variables: You can come back to these later later by going to settings and config Vars Enable in Heroku! Note! The API_SECRET is the main password allowing full access to your Nightscout site. Make sure its secure (mix upper and lowercase letters, plus digits) and do no not share it publicly. If you think you exposed it by mistake, it is recommended that you change it. 7. API_SECRET will be your Nightscout site password, it needs to be at least 12 characters long and you should NOT use spaces if you use @ or ! symbol you should NOT use spaces if you use @ or ! symbols remember you will probably need to express them using Percent encoding in your uploader and downloader apps. If you're not sure on how to do this, it is recommended to use only letters (uppercase + lowercase) and digits . 8. If you want to link your Dexcom Share account as a data source, complete the following 3 lines: Warning! Common Errors MOST COMMON ERRORS The BRIDGE_PASSWORD and BRIDGE_USER_NAME are NOT visible from within your Dexcom app or online account. These values are what you entered into your Dexcom mobile app when you logged into that app for the VERY FIRST time. The BRIDGE_USER_NAME is not an email address. The most common error on initial Nightscout setups is that people incorrectly use an old account or an old password. To test your username and password, go to Dexcom's Clarity page (check here See Here for USA accounts and Here here for the others) and try logging in to your Dexcom account. If your account info isn't valid, or you don't see any data in your Clarity account... you need to figure out your actual credentials before moving ahead. 9. If you want to link your Care Link account as a data source (currently not functional with Heroku), complete the following lines: 10. Select the units you\u2019re using in DISPLAY_UNITS the acceptable choices are mg/dl or mmol/L (or just mmol when entering it). In my case I used mmol Plugins 11. In ENABLE, copy and paste the following Plugins below (separated by a space) so that won't have to think about which you want now and learn the rest later!

Now you need the connection string you defined during the Atlas cluster creation - Part 3 (as the example below, but not the string below). Copy and paste your! results into the MONGODB_URI variable field in Heroku vars. 13. I will try to give you an example about the way to do it again below, you can also see my video if you get stuck! A. In the boxes below 1st is your Atlas Account you gave yourself a User Name add it to the box below User Name on the left side! B. Then you also made a Database user Password add your Password you created for your database add this too into the box on the left side. C.

Papertrail is not needed at all, edit the line with the pensil icon and add DISABLED at the end, so that you can recover the function if you need it later. Congratulations Nightscout is now setup! Enable Auto Deploys in Heroku Automatic deploys will allow you to update routinely your Heroku apps when you renew the GitHub repository. You will then not need to login into Heroku and execute Manual Deploy, as soon as do a new version of the repo be merged into GitHub an automatic deploy will trigger in all enabled Heroku apps. a) To allow automatic deploy, log in Heroku and select your app, in my case diabeticway and then selecting the Deploy section . b) Select Connect to Github c) Authenticate GitHub and your cgm-remote-monitor app are now connected. d) Click on search and add your repo name, it will then connect to Github e) Verify the master branch is selected and click Enable Automatic Deploys . f) Your site will update automatically every time you update the GitHub repository now.

If you're already using xDrip+ and don't find a feature documented here and want it, you might need to update your xDrip+ app. See at the bottom of each page the version at which it was written, if you have an older version it might not include the feature. If you're completely new to xDrip+ and you want to install it for the first time continue to Download xdrip Or Install xdrip Specifications You need an Android phone. Minimum supported Android version is 4.4 but 6 and above is recommended. If you will connect xDrip+ to a sensor your phone must support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): you can use utilities like this one to check. If you want to use the embedded master - follower function of xDrip+ (called xDrip+ Sync) both phones must have the Google Play Services installed. In order to use NFC scanning features for Libre 1 and 2 (EU only) sensors, or to connect directly to a Libre 2 (EU) sensor your phone needs a compatible NFC reader. If using Android 10 and above make sure you use a recent version of xDrip+ (at least the latest release, we'll talk about it later: continue reading). Translation The documentation is only available in English for now. You might find it easier to follow if you switch your xDrip+ to English and read it using and automatic translation with Google. 1. xdrip\u00b1 Hamburger Menu To get to your settings click on the left Hamburger bar at the top. 2. xdrip\u00b1 Settings Search There are lots of settings in xDrip+, So a search for things by looking for, use the search bar at the top right and enter the keyword you're looking for. 3. xdrip\u00b1 Settings List There are lots of settings in xDrip+, So a search for things by looking for, use the search bar at the top right and enter the keyword you're looking for. 4. xdrip\u00b1 Glucose Units In this menu you can select the units used by xDrip+ (mg/dl or mmol/l) and set high and low targets.
